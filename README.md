# Using imaging and phenotypic data on the UK Biobank
This repository contains open code written for those working on imaging and phenotypic data on the UK Biobank RAP (as opposed to working on the BMRC cluster directly).
It will (soon) contain worked examples using image derived phenotype data on the UKBRAP.
The information on this repository is the property of the authors alone, not the UKB. The example used in the main UKBRAP section is purely for demonstration.
